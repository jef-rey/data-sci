## Part 3
# Tying it all together
As in the last project, we're going to pull in what we've already worked on and start from there

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
include <- function(library_name){
  if( !(library_name %in% installed.packages()) )
    install.packages(library_name) 
  library(library_name, character.only=TRUE)
}
include("tidyverse")
include("knitr")
include("rvest")
include("ggplot2")
purl("part2.Rmd", output = "part2.r")
source("part2.r")
```
