## *385 - Data Science - Portfolio Project*
In this data science project, I analyze, tidy and clean, model, and plot data.
I have separated this project into three parts.
In [part 1](p1.html) , I introduce a data set on crime based around the Denver, CO area and clean and tidy it.
In [part 2](part2.html), I use a niche R library to pull in weather data, clean and tidy it using Tidy Data principles. I attemped to merge the two data sets, and run a linear regression model on the two data sets.
In [part 3](part3.html), I revisit parts 1 and 2, clean them further with the knowledge I've gained throughout the semester, and try to tie it all together.

You can see all three parts by clicking the corresponding link:
